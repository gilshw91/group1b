<h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Hokus Mokus, also known as Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, was a joke shop located at Number 93 Diagon Alley
        founded by Fred and George Weasley.<br/>
The shop contained practical joke objects. This establishment started out as an 'owl-post service' led by the twins
        from the Burrow,<br/>and later continued from Hogwarts, selling joke-products until the store front was opened.<br/>
The shop was the Weasley twins' dream, they got the seed money for the shop from Harry Potter</p>
<p>Fred participated in the Battle of Hogwarts (1998), defending the castle's passageways with his twin.
    While fighting he was killed in an explosion.</p>
