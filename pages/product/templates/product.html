<!-- Hi! do you know why the background image of the page is smaller? not fitted to all of the page?
this with the picture of the product which I cant see.. needs to check if its in the base.css or in your css
the heading of Rating & Reviews are not at the correct place. it is places aside to the product's description
-->
